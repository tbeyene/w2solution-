# Q1: Indicate the sample mean payroll price in millions. Round your result to
# the nearest million.

round(mean(baseball$Payroll.millions))

# Q2: Indicate the corresponding standard deviation. Round your result to the
# nearest million.

round(sd(baseball$Payroll.millions))

# Q3: What is the correlation coefficient for payroll in millions and number of
# wins? Round your result to two decimal places.

round(cor(baseball$Wins, baseball$Payroll.millions), 2) # note that since the number ends in a zero you do not see that zero

# Q4: Interpret the correlation coefficient reported above.

# There is a positive correlation between the payroll in millions and the number
# of wins in a season. Hence, when the payroll goes up we would also expect to
# see a higher number of wins, and vice versa.


# The owner of a gasoline service station wants to study whether his advertising
# campaign has increased the amount of gasoline purchased by motorists at his
# station. Before the campaign the average purchase was 10 gallons. In a random
# sample of 60 motorists, the mean purchase is 11.3 gallons with a standard
# deviation of 3.1 gallons. At the 1% level of significance, test whether the
# average purchase is larger than 10 gallons.

# Q5: Write down the formal version of the null and alternative hypotheses.

# H_0: \mu <= 10
# H_a: \mu > 10


# Q6: Explain why the appropriate test statistic is a t statistic rather than a
# z-score.

# We do not know the population standard deviation, only the sample standard
# deviation. Hence, we cannot use the z-statistics but need the t-statistics.
# The t-statistics is Student t distributed when the sample population is
# normal.

# Q7: Compute the test statistic with 3 decimals.

round((11.3 - 10)/(3.1/sqrt(60)), 3)

tsum.test(11.3, 3.1, 60, mu = 10) # If you would rather not write the formula

# Q8: What are the degrees of freedom for the test statistics?

60 - 1 # We "lose" one degree of freedom because we calculate a mean

# Q9: What is the critical value for rejecting the null hypothesis? You can
# either round up or down with your degrees of freedom when you look up the
# number in the t table.

qt(0.99, 59) # We want the right-hand side of the distribution since we are testing whether mu is larger than 10

# Q10: Is there sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis? What is your
# interpretation of this result? Explain briefly.

# We reject the null hypothesis that the mean is equal to or less than 10
# gallons after the advertising campaign because the t statistics of 3.248 is
# larger than the critical value of 2.39.

# You can also find the p-value by using pt(). Remember that it give you the PDF
# for everything to the left of the value!
1 - pt(3.248, 59)
